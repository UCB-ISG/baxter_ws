# Known Issues so far

- baxter_sim_example that uses IK fails to find solution
    This is not a bug in the example python script itself
    The failure happens in a service node (likely in the simulator/emulator itself)


# Speculative status

## GUI seems functional (xx v4 => v5)
### Python interpreter explicitly set (seems effective)

## General simulator functionality seems okay so far

## Interaction with actual robot UNTESTED

## Are low-level ROS changes impacting things???
### Are there backward-compatible flags/params that could help???



## Python2 => Python3 discrepancies

### Seems likely there are subtle bugs remaining in untested code/scripts

### Python 2to3 tweaks seem successful, but need thourough TESTing
